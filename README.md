## Future Scope

We plan to include NLP(natural language processing) features to make the bot able to respond to various inputs of the users accordingly. This will ensure diverse and easy chatting options for the users and will expand the user base as different languages can be used to use our bot. The bot is currently usable in the telegram app. We plan to expand its usability to WhatsApp and other common social media sites according to growing user requirements. Also, we will add a multi-lingual facility. 



## Feedback
